The **UAP Literary Club** at the University of Asia Pacific is a vibrant community where students unite over their shared passion for literature, creativity, and friendship.

Amid the academic pressures, the club offers a space for relaxation and self-expression through various activities like **path-chakra**, writing competitions, movie sessions, and lively discussions.

Our most anticipated event, the **Lit Fest**, brings the entire campus together to celebrate literature in a colorful festival of words and ideas.
